    <p>Hi!</p> 

    <p>I am a microeconomic theorist working on (Behavioral) Mechanism/Market Design and Information Economics. <br>My current work focuses on problems with asymmetric information and boundedly rational agents.</p>

    <p>I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the <a href="https://www.esomas.unito.it/" target="_blank">Department of Economics, Social Studies, Applied Mathematics, and Statistics (ESOMAS) at the University of Turin</a>, Italy.</p>
    
    <p>I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Pittsburgh.<br> I am originally from Chile, where I graduated with a BA in Economics and Business and an MA in Economics from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
        <p>We analyze the surplus extraction problem in a mechanism design setting with consideration sets. We study a bounded rationality version of a general mechanism design environment with correlation in which the agent evaluates only a subset of types as possible deviations. We call these subsets the agent's consideration sets. We identify the inverse consideration sets as the key elements that determine whether full extraction is feasible in this setting and characterize the conditions beliefs need to satisfy to guarantee full surplus extraction. These conditions require the beliefs of each type to be separated from the beliefs of types in his inverse consideration set only. This relaxes the independence condition in Crémer and McLean (1988), which remains sufficient in our setting. Finally, we discuss some applications and limitations of our model.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>Abstract</summary>
        <p>We study a monopolistic screening problem with boundedly rational buyers and a noisy communication technology. In particular, the seller will be able to design a menu with a finite number of quality-price pairs but the buyers will not be able to observe the full menu. Instead, buyers will have access only to a finite number of samples from the menu of alternatives offered by the seller and then decide which alternative to purchase if any. This procedure gives rise to random consideration sets from the perspective of the buyers. We show that if there is a single sample available, the seller will optimally choose to offer a single alternative, while if two samples are available then neither offering a single alternative nor two alternatives is necessarily optimal.</p>
